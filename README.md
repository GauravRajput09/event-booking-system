# Project Setup Guide

This README provides instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommended version 16.x or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run one of the following commands based on your package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

The project requires environment variables to function properly. An example file (`env.example`) is provided as a template.

Copy the example environment file to create your `.env` file:

```bash
# Using bash/zsh
cp env.example .env

# Using Windows Command Prompt
copy env.example .env

# Using PowerShell
Copy-Item env.example .env
```

Open the newly created `.env` file and update the values as needed for your environment.

### 4. Running the application

#### Development mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev
```

#### Production mode

To build and run the application in production mode:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build
npm start

# Using yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Accessing the application

Once running, the application should be available at:

- Development: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (default port, may vary based on your configuration)
- Production: Check the console output for the serving URL

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in your `.env` file
2. Check that you've installed all dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Make sure the required ports are not in use by other applications
